# KR-QR

## Requirements
### Python packages
- [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/)
- [graphviz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphviz)

### Programs
- [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)

## Generating the state graph and transitions
```bash
python3 main.py [-f OUTFILE]
```
This command generated a file that contains all the states, and the possible transitions between them. The file can in turn be used in any visualization program, one of which is included in this repository.

## Generating a visualization of the state graph
```bash
python3 graph_states [-f INFILE]
```
The visualization of the state graph uses graphviz.

# Sample output
Some output is given, and present in the `data/` folder. It contains the following items:
- `default.pik` Example data for the standard model state graph as generated by the reasoner
- `extra.pik` Data generated for the "extra" model state graph
- `default.gv` Dot file representing the standard model state graph
- `default.pdf` The standard model state graph visualized
- `extra.gv` Dot file representing the "extra" model state graph
- `extra.pdf` The "extra" model state graph visualized
## Trace
- `default.output` Example output as printed during the generation of the standard model state graph.
- `extra.output` Example output as printed during the generation of the "extra" model state graph.
